What we did:
- fully customizable scheduler
- all the schedulers:
 - fifo
 - ...
- random schedplan generator
- fixes per cfs:
 - correct handling of non-zero arrival time
 - added preemption check in case of non-zero arrival time
 - implemented functionality for minimum granularity
  - this required a multitude of fixes (search for "WARNING")
- latex:
 - fixed "export data" that missed the waits
 - added tables
 - fixed missing text inside boxes
 - added marker for preemption checks
 - added option to move inline text below the plot
